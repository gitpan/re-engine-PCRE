* Changes related to getting things to work on a threaded perl.
  This identified several issues with the API that needed to be 
  worked around. Once the appropriate patches are applied to perl
  they wont be needed.
  
* This includes stuff relating to the SWIG wrapper which I wasnt sure 
  how to do so hand hacked the pcre_wrap.c. The pcre.i file contains
  a comment indicating some code that needs to go into the SWIG_init()
  function.

  NOTE: To be honest I think SWIG in this context is overkill. I think
  it could be stripped down to a simple XS module and most of prce_wrap
  thrown away. See the bleadperl ext/re directory for some template
  code that could be taken.
